# Wadi2D

A CUDA 2D shallow-water solver with the hydrology inside the same model, for wadi flood work: steep hill catchments, alluvial fans,
braided wadis, several outfalls. Full shallow-water equations, sub-grid terrain in cells and faces (a breakline on high ground is a
wall until overtopped), a mesh generator, catchment delineation, HEC-HMS-style lumped hydrology for the hills with rain-on-grid for
the plain, ARF the HMS depth-area way, gridded rainfall input, terrain modification for dams and channels, a Windows UI with a live
view of the run. Design flows at design points and full-catchment flood maps, in minutes on one GPU.

**State (2026-10-29): decided and recorded, nothing researched or coded. Next: `W1 research and design note`.** The profile, the
decisions with their reasons and the open questions are in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Test case

Block 2 of the Batinah flood protection project (`D:\Mojtaba\Renardet\2224 WS11\Batinah\Block 2`): the HEC-HMS 4.12 model, the
0.5 m terrain and the W1 inflow peaks at the five dam sites. His files are read-only; copies for tests live under this folder.
